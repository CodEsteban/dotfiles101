# dotfiles101

![take a look](rice.png)
in terms of perfomance it behaves pretty well, is very minimal except for [Picom](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Picom), blur does not run as i expected, seem bloated just for now 
If you use dwm or xmonad, you might still have to slighly change some settings
